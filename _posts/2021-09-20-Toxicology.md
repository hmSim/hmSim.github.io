[4th] Biotransformation
Biotransformation이란?

Phase I Rx: Hydrolysis(가수분해), Reduction(환원), Oxidation(산화)

# 1) Hydrolysis(가수분해)
- Carboxylesterases(CES)
- Epoxide hydrolase
- Cholinesterases(eg. AChE)
- PON1 and PON3(human paraoxonase 1 and 3)
- Organophosphatases
- alkaline phosphatase
- Beta-glucuronidase

# 2) Reduction(환원)
- # Carbonyl dehydrogenation
-- Human Aldo-Keto Reductases(AKRs)
--- Aldehyde reducase
--- Dihydroiol dehydrogenase
--- Aflatoxin B1 Aldehyde reductase
-- Short-Chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases(SDRs)
--- Cytocolic carbonyl reductase
--- microsomal carbonyl reductase
-- Medium-Chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases(MDRs)
--- ADH
-- Quinone Reductases(NQOs)
--- NQO1 and others

3) Oxidation(산화)

Phase II Rx: Glucuronidation, Sulfonation, Methylation, Acetylation

# 1) Glucuronidation

# 2) Sulfonation

# 3) Methylation

# 4) Acetylation


용어정리
- Shunt: 반응 cycle에서 2 step 이상을 건너뛰는 현상
- Glutathione: Glutamine, Glycine 그리고 Cysteine의 결합으로 이루어진 환원제
